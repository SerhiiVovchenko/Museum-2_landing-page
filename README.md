Head over to my newly created layout page  Museum.

This colorful design gave me the inspiration for the work.

[Figma:rocket:](https://www.figma.com/file/HL3XGt5ZatvJoYBhOaWY5x/museum-prototype?node-id=323-1957)

The project was created on the basis of Bem's methodology.

This project is designed to work with various extensions, namely:

The design 1440px

Desktop 1280px

Tablet 640px

Mobile (> 320px)


<strong>In this project, such technologies were used as:</strong>
    
  •	 <strong>HTML ( cross-browsing and valid code)</strong>
  
  •	 <strong>CSS</strong>
  
    o	flex
    
    o       grid (universal block construction scheme)
    
    o	modules
    
    o	responsive technologes
    
  •	 <strong>SCSS</strong>
  
    o	variables
    
    o	mixins
    
    o	extends
    
    o	and other
  
   •<strong>javaScript initial.</strong>


The transition between the main page and the menu is implemented exclusively on the capabilities of HTML and CSS.

Thank you for devoting a little time and positive emotions to my work)
